# Cluster-Analysis
Cluster analysis project- 1974 motor cars.

In this project, we discuss partitioning and hierarchical clustering techniques
and how we can apply these techniques in the statistical programme R. We
will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method of clustering and
compare the similarities and differences between partitioning and hierarchical
clustering methods.
